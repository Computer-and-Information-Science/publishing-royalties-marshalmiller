# Publishing Royalties  

A new author is in the process of negotiating a contract for a new romance novel. The publisher is offering three options. In the first option, the author is paid $5,000 upon delivery of the final manuscript and $20,000 when the novel is published. In the second option, the author is paid 12.5% of the net price of the novel for each copy of the novel sold. In the third option, the author is paid 10% of the net price for the first 4,000 copies sold, and 14% of the net price for the copies sold over 4,000. The author has some idea about the number of copies that will be sold and would like to have an estimate of the royalties generated under each option.

Write a program that prompts the author to enter the net price of each copy of the novel and the estimated number of copies that will be sold. The program then outputs the royalties under each option and the best option the author could choose.

Use appropriate named constants to store special values such as royalties and percentages.

When prompting for inputs, prompt for the two values in the order they are specified above; prompt for  the price of each copy first, then prompt for the number of copies that will be sold. Price will be in dollars and cents. Number of copies will be a whole number.

Your output should consists of a nicely formatted table showing the expected royalties for option 1, option 2, and option 3, followed by a statement saying which of the three options is best (pays the most). Formatting of the table is up to you, but be sure to use two decimal places when dollars and cents are involved. Ensure that there is at least one blank line between your prompts and input and the start of your table of results.

The statement of the best option should read as follows:

    The best option is option #1.

The test cases are set up to look for the above statement exactly as shown, matching case and punctuation, with either `1`, `2`, or `3` following the `#`.
